# CRM Implementation with JavaScript and IndexedDB
The purpose of this project, [Proyecto 2: Implementaci√≥n de Funcionalidades con JavaScript](https://silver-succotash-n1q835e.pages.github.io/docs/proyectos/proyecto2/#objetivos-del-proyecto) is to simulate a common 
scenario in the life of a web developer. It challenges students to learn and apply new technologies rapidly to meet the 
needs of clients. In this project, students are required to implement various functionalities using JavaScript in a 
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. The project aims to achieve the following objectives:

Implement form validation using JavaScript events.
Simplify validation procedures with the use of regular expressions.
Utilize the browser's storage capabilities to save and retrieve information.
Test and document the code thoroughly.

## The project is divided into two parts:

### Part 1: Investigation and Learning of IndexedDB
In this section, students are tasked with researching and learning about IndexedDB, a technology used for data 
management in current web applications. They are expected to explore the capabilities, syntax, and best practices of 
IndexedDB. Additionally, they must document their learning process by creating a guide or cheatsheet summarizing key 
aspects of IndexedDB, from initial configuration to advanced operations, such as transactions and queries. This material
will serve as a valuable reference for future projects.

### Part 2: Implementation of Functionalities in the CRM
After gaining knowledge about IndexedDB in Part 1, students proceed to the implementation of various functionalities 
within the CRM. The specific functionalities to be implemented include:

- Implementing comprehensive form validation with real-time validation using JavaScript events.
- Adding logic to ensure that the "Add Customer" button is only active when all form data is valid. When pressed, the 
customer will be added to the CRM's customer list. 
- Creating a dynamic list of customers, with the ability to edit and 
delete customers, and ensuring that changes persist in the browser using IndexedDB for data storage. 
- Ensuring data persistence, allowing customer information to remain available in the browser even after it's closed, 
- thanks to efficient data storage and retrieval using IndexedDB.

Students are encouraged to explore and implement additional functionalities, with innovation and creativity being 
positively valued.

In summary, this project challenges students to rapidly learn and apply IndexedDB and JavaScript to implement various 
functionalities in a CRM system. It emphasizes real-world scenarios where web developers need to adapt to new 
technologies and meet client requirements efficiently.
